# America's first investigative journalist got her start in an asylum
Trailblazer Nellie Bly first went undercover in a New York psychiatric hospital in 1887, when she exposed its horrific conditions.

In 1885 the Pittsburgh Dispatch published an article entitled “What Girls Are Good For,” which claimed a working woman was “a monstrosity.” The feature provoked a fiery rebuke from a 21-year-old reader, Elizabeth Jane Cochran, whose argument so impressed the editor that he published an advertisement asking the author to come forward so he could meet her.

She did, and he hired her on the spot, her first article appearing under the name “Orphan Girl.” Soon after, she changed her pen name to the title of a popular song by Pittsburgh songwriter Stephen Foster, and so “Nellie Bly” was born—a name forever associated with her pioneering role in investigative journalism.

In the course of her life, she spotlighted social ills and corruption, often at great personal risk, resulting in important reforms. Distinguishing herself in the almost exclusively male world of late 19th-century journalism, she broke new ground for women in the field.

Bly—who would refer to herself by her pen name, even in her private life—had originally written as “Orphan Girl” in a reference to her difficult upbringing. Born in 1864 near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, she grew up in relative comfort until her father’s death when she was six years old. Money became tight, especially after her mother’s abusive second marriage ended in divorce. At 15, Bly ended her formal education, for lack of funds, to run a boardinghouse with her mother for five years. These years of struggle fed her ambition to succeed and a commitment as a journalist to call attention to the hardships of working-class families.

Despite clinching her job on the Dis­patch, Bly resented being restricted to writing only for the women’s section of the paper. Frustrated, she went to Mexico alone to work as a correspondent, a virtually unheard-of step for a woman in the 1880s. She covered a range of topics, but those that singled out corruption and exploitation of peasants and workers provoked the ire of the authoritarian government. She was forced to leave to avoid arrest, and back in Pittsburgh found herself reassigned to the women’s section at the Dispatch. Disillusioned, she decided to leave for the big leagues: New York.
